Madison Academic High School â€“ Girl Talk Club

The Madison Academic High School Girl Talk Club is one of the newly founded clubs that Madison has to offer. We talked to Mrs. Lane about developing a website that would be beneficial for both club members, and their leader. This is the first time the club will have its own website.

The website was created by Kiauna Steele and Mekenzie Coleman to help club members be aware of upcoming events and club days.

The Website

1. Our website may be easily accessed on any device or computer and is easy to navigate.

2. We have created a navigational bar at the top of the page containing five different tabs. Each tab contains content that relates to the club. The tabs are: Home, About, Big Sisters, Calendar, Events, and Club Scheduling. The about tab will give insight to the foundation of the club to potential members. The Big Sisters tab lists all the senior mentors. The Calendar page contains a Calendar which changes with the months to keep members aware of approaching days. The events tab will list the events for every month. And the Club Scheduling tab will list the days the club will meet.

3. Our Website is also very colorful to symbolize the individuality of each member of the club.
